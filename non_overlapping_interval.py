# Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
# Example 2:

# Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
# Example 3:

# Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
